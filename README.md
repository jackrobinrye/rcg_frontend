# Random Character Generator (RCG) Frontend 

# Summary
This program autogenerates D&D characters for you (class and racial stat bonuses not included). You add new players and each player can have a set of however many randomized characters.

# Building Components
The files in this repo contain all you need for your javascript frontend to my Random Character Generator project! 
In the index.js file is all the code to handle the creation of individual characters and individual players. 
In the character.js and player.js files you have the brief but important code to create character and player objects.
There is a style.css file for styling the tables and text of the index.html file.
